# Project Demo Landing
* This webpage is basically intended to replicate a random project website's landing.
* It contains an image with title and description and a button that redirects the user to a video player that plays a video (e.g., trailer of the project).
* The workings have been described in the comments inside the code.
* The picture-in-picture section was not recorded properly. It is 100% working.
